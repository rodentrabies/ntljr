## not too long; just read

A community-based knowledge repository that enforces scrupulosity
of information with help of rating system, inspired by my own admiration for terse
mathematical definitions and a deep belief, that there is no universal point of view:
take a handful of them and decide for yourself, which one fits better.


## Core concepts

Core of the system is built around the notion of *definition* -
a very dense piece of information with restricted size. Each query to the system
gives user access to few top-rated and few random (to preserve ballance)
*definitions* of a concept searched for. Each new *definition* only enhance knowledge
base, without erasing any existing *definition* of the same concept.
